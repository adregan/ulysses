title: Two pages of Ulysses a day
---
A few weeks before Bloomsday, you realize that you put off reading *Ulysses* for another year, and realistically, if you start now, you probably won't finish in time. June 16, 2014 then. If you read two pages a day for the next year, you ought to make it. And, with all that extra time, you might as well retype those two pages.

And that's what I'm going to do. Over the next year, I'm retyping *Ulysses* two pages a day.
