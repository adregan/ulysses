<p>A few weeks before Bloomsday, you realize that you put off reading <em>Ulysses</em> for another year, and realistically, if you start now, you probably won't finish in time. June 16, 2014 then. If you read two pages a day for the next year, you ought to make it. And, with all that extra time, you might as well retype those two pages.</p>

<p>And that's what I'm going to do. Over the next year, I'm retyping <em>Ulysses</em> two pages a day.</p>
