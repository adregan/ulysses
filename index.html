<h1 class="decorative-title page-title">Ulysses a day</h1>
<p>Every year, a few weeks before Bloomsday, you remember that you put off reading Ulysses that you won't finish it in time. But, you can probably finish it if you read two pages a day for the next year. 2014 then. With all that time, why don't you type out those two pages every day?</p>
