<p class="readable">A few weeks before Bloomsday, you realize that you put off reading <em>Ulysses</em> for another year, and realistically, if you start now, you probably won't finish in time. June 16, 2014 then. If you read two pages a day for the next year, you ought to make it. And, with all that extra time, you might as well type out those two pages.</p>
